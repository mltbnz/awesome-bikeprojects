## Projects
* [Radmesser](https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/radmesser/index.html) - The Tagesspiegel, together with physicists, experts in artificial intelligence and designers, has developed its own sensor to find out how close car and bicycle drivers are in Berlin's city traffic.
* [fixmyberlin](https://fixmyberlin.de/planungen) - The Berlin-based FixMyBerlin project analyzes all major roads in the city according to their cycling infrastructure and keep track of where construction projects are really being implemented ([source code](https://github.com/FixMyBerlin)).

* [Streetmix](https://streetmix.net) - Design, remix and share your street. Add cycle paths, widen sidewalks or lanes, and find out how that affects your community ([source code](https://github.com/streetmix/streetmix)).
